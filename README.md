# Embedded-Air-Quality-Measurement-System
**Project Description:**

Our project aims to develop an embedded system for monitoring and indicating the Air Quality Index (AQI) based on various environmental measurements. This system will serve as an essential tool for assessing air quality and its impact on health and the environment.

**Objective:**
The primary objective of this project is to create a robust and efficient embedded system capable of:

1. Monitoring environmental parameters using a network of sensors.
2. Calculating a rolling AQI value based on the collected data.
3. Transmitting the AQI data to a cloud service for archival and analysis.
4. Adding local measurements to enhance the accuracy of the AQI calculation.
5. Reporting the calculated AQI and associated data to a different cloud service for further analysis and visualization.

**Components:**

1. **Sensors Network:** We will deploy a network of sensors capable of measuring various environmental parameters such as particulate matter (PM), carbon monoxide (CO), nitrogen dioxide (NO2), ozone (O3), and sulfur dioxide (SO2).

2. **Embedded System:** The core of our project will be an embedded system responsible for collecting, processing, and transmitting sensor data. This system will be equipped with microcontrollers, communication modules, and processing units to perform real-time data analysis and calculation of the AQI.

3. **Cloud Services Integration:** We will utilize cloud services such as ThingSpeak for data storage, archival, and visualization. Additionally, we will integrate another cloud service for reporting and further analysis of the AQI data.

**Workflow:**

1. **Data Collection:** The sensors network will continuously monitor environmental parameters and transmit the data to the embedded system.

2. **Data Processing:** The embedded system will receive the sensor data, filter out noise, and calculate the AQI value using predefined algorithms. It will also incorporate local measurements to refine the AQI calculation.

3. **Cloud Integration:** The calculated AQI data will be transmitted to ThingSpeak for archival and visualization. Simultaneously, the processed data will be reported to another cloud service for additional analysis.

4. **Reporting:** The AQI data, along with associated measurements, will be made available for stakeholders and authorities through a user-friendly interface provided by the second cloud service.

**Expected Outcome:**

Upon successful implementation, our project will deliver an integrated solution for real-time monitoring and reporting of air quality. The system will provide valuable insights into environmental conditions, enabling timely interventions and policy decisions to mitigate air pollution and safeguard public health.

By leveraging IoT technologies and cloud services, we aim to establish a scalable and adaptable framework that can be deployed in various settings to address air quality challenges effectively.

**Conclusion:**

Our project endeavors to contribute to the ongoing efforts in environmental monitoring and management by developing an innovative embedded system for AQI indication and reporting. Through collaboration with stakeholders and the adoption of cutting-edge technologies, we strive to create a sustainable solution with a tangible impact on air quality assessment and improvement initiatives.
